# Statistical measures

We define the follwoing statistical measures

## Read level 

- TP - a successfully corrected read, i.e. all the erros were fixed
- FP - read was with no errors and we introduced errors in the read
- FN - read was not corrected, read was with errors before and remain with errors. Thsi may corresponds to the scenario when some errors were corrected, but no tall of them 
- TN - read was untouched, it was with no errors and remains woth no errors afetr error correction

When we define PPV, Sensitivity, Gain and Accuracy  

# How Statistical measures are computed across datasets

## Rep_Seq_sm

We simulate the TCR transcrips as described in
